A GitHub Action that cancels workflows if total account usage exceeds a defined threshold.

## Usage

```yaml
# This is the name of your GitHub Actions workflow
name: Main Workflow

# This workflow gets triggered on every push to your repository
on: [push]

# These are your workflow's jobs. Each job represents a process that your workflow will run.
jobs:
  setup:
    # Runs the job on the latest Ubuntu version
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # This is a step to checkout the code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Uses the action-usage-guard action
      - name: Run Action Usage Guard
        uses: nekofar/action-usage-guard@v1
        with:
          # GitHub access token for authentication.
          token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          # Defines the threshold for the usage guard.
          threshold: 70

      # You can add as many steps as you want. Here is another example step.
      - name: Another Step
        # For illustration, we use actions/hello-world-docker-action
        uses: actions/hello-world-docker-action@v1
        with:
          who-to-greet: 'GitHub Actions'
```

## Token

To make use of this action, a **Fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT)** is essential. The PAT needs to be configured differently based on whether it is for a user account or an organization account.

If you use it for a user account, you need **Read** access to plan, **Read** access to metadata, and **Read** and **Write** access to actions.

If you use it for an organization, you need **Read** access to organization administration, **Read** access to metadata, and **Read** and **Write** access to actions.

Make sure to generate and handle the PAT securely, following the best practices for security. The access permissions can be managed by the user and organization administrators based on their security policies and requirements. If you require further assistance setting this up, please feel free to ask!

## Options

The configuration used in the GitHub Action workflow includes several options for customization. Each of these
configuration options has a specific use and can be tailored to suit your specific workflow needs. Below is a table
depicting these options:

| Option       | Description                                                                                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `token`      | This is the actual GitHub access token for authentication.                                           |
| `threshold`  | (Optional) This defines the threshold value (1-100) for the usage guard action. The default is `70`. |

Each option should be carefully considered to ensure that your workflow proceeds as expected.
